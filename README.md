# LAVAMANAGER DLC:

This is a repository of DLC and Exports, converted to work in LavaManager for RB3E Wii (Rock Band 3 Enhanced).
All songs will *eventually* be pre-packaged with upgrades from the RBHP (Rock Band Harmonies Project), RB3PLUS (Rock Band 3 Plus), and RB4PLUS (Rock Band 4 Plus).
The goal of this repo is to make Wii more accessable, and to allow songs to be in an open-folder structure for simple adding and editing.
Also has the bonus of a majority of the songs having *better* sound quality, and more drum tracks.

Currently, not every song is 100% compatable with Wii Hardware, but should work in Dolphin no problem!
This is being planned to be fixed up in the future. 

(light downsampling is planned for hardware, nothing too harsh tho. think 38000 rate)

Try it on Wii at your own risk!

(please note Wii online multiplayer has not been tested, but again Dolphin should be a-ok)

# INSTALLATION

Install [RB3E](https://github.com/RBEnhanced/RB3Enhanced), and download [LavaManager](https://github.com/RBEnhanced/RB3Enhanced). 
Select your RB3 folder on your SD Card within the program.
Drag over the "RB3" folder downloaded within each assigned export or DLC folder into the same folder your RB3E's RB3 Folder.
Reload your song list on LavaManager, and hit finalize.
You should see your added songs in LavaManager at this point.

Now just launch RB3E, and play!

# CURRENT ISSUES

Some songs again, are not downsampled. You WILL stutter playing them on real hardware. Fixes are coming, but not until RB1/4 DLC is done.

Upgrades are also not available for every song, as I may of skimmed over it. Submit an issue if I forgot one, I will be happy to add it!

Currently drum mixes are just broken, this is due to RB3 Wii bein silly. Max of 2 drum tracks. (some official wii dlc was broken because of this too!)

A patched RB3DX for Dolphin and Wii that'll allow every drum mix is planned, but is just not uploaded yet. Be patient!

# DOLPHIN NOTES

It's recommended you make an SD card file using the Virtual SD Card Maker tool, using the ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver to mount and edit it.
You ARE able to use Dolphin's WiiSDSync folder, however the automatic sync will take a VERY long time when many songs are added.

Both programs and guides are found [HERE](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/virtual-sd-card-guide/).
